# Sleep, circadian rhythms, and source memory across the lifespan

The goal of this project is to understand how changes in sleep and circadian rhythms influence memory across the lifespan. Previous work suggests that older adults experience parallel declines in sleep and episodic memory. These age-related changes appear to be linked such that sleep disruptions contribute to deficits in memory performance. We plan to investigate which components of memory performance rely on specific characteristics of sleep.

In addition, given the prevalence of commercially-available activity monitoring devices (e.g., Fitbit), we aim to evaluate the ability of such devices to accurately classify sleep stages and elements of the rest-activity cycle, compared to results obtained through traditional clinical and research methods, such as overnight EEG.
